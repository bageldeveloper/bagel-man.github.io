<p>Jerk
    By Tom Moore
    
    Chapter 1
    “Melissa”
    
    Max the cat sat on the rug in the living room. That's all that he really does. He likes to sun himself. You may be thinking, “Well this story sounds terrible because it’s probably just about a cat being a jerk while sitting on the couch”, and you’re half right. The sun slowly drifted through the sky until Max woke up because the sun had moved and he was now in the shade without the sun engulfing him. He was in a serious predicament, he wanted to be in the sun but he was also in a very comfortable position and did not want to move. “Why can’t the sun stay in one spot all the time?”, he thought to himself. “Then I would never have to move or do absolutely anything”, he thought about ways he could be in the sun at all times and realized he could sit on the windowsill. He stumbled over to it and jumped onto the windowsill to get in the sunlight. But then the worst thing imaginable happened, his stomach grumbled. He would have to get up and eat to make this very inconvenient thing stop growling. After he was done eating he came back into the living room and saw a cloud had gone in front of the sun. Max eventually gave up and went to go look for Melissa. Nobody knows why Max loves Melissa, her pets aren’t that good. Tom is great at petting and always gives Max attention but NO, he HAS to get pet by “Melissa” After looking around the house Max gave up looking for “Melissa” and took a nap in the living room. He had an amazing dream about him taking a nap in the living room, cats are so self absorbed. Max woke up to the sound of Melissa. He could sense that she was in a mile radius of him. Then, the garage door suddenly opened and there she was, the beauty herself, Melissa.
    Max straightened his back and acted firm and official, he had to impress the almighty. The big man with a beard then tried to attract max with spspspspspsps and snaps of the fingers. Max ignored this joke and walked right up to Melissa purring and rubbing himself against Melissa’s leg. Melissa looked down at him, bent down, and pet him! Oh what a glorious moment, she has noticed me! Melissa then walked away and started up the stairs. Max would follow her, but for unexplainable reasons, Max absolutely despised the upstairs. He would rarely go up there even if Melissa was up there. Since the almighty had left, he went to play with his toys. Max playing with his toys is an absolutely beautiful thing. This thicc cat is bouncing around and chasing his toys with all his fat just glistening. Max is a sort of pioneer to mega chonkers, he’s just such a big boi. Everyone eventually migrated upstairs to leave Max alone, so there was no one to pet him. The sky was getting darker and darker when Max heard a meow.
    
    Chapter 2
    The fight
    
    Max was startled by the familiar meow that came from the garage and the chruncing of his food. Max tentatively crept over to the garage door, when it hit him. The smelly smell, the smelly of the smelliest smelly smell smell smelly smell fest smellier than all the smells. It was him… His greatest rival, the neighborhood thief, Dillian. Max didn’t know his actual name because they were always too busy fighting for him to ask, so he assigned him the name Dillian. Max decided to get right to the normal routine by attacking Dillian for eating his food. He lunged at him and (This violent scene has been censored by the elements it contains, Max does not mess around when it comes to food). After Max made Dillian cower in fear and run away, Max decided to start his night. He walked out to the backyard to meet his partner in crime, Reuben. Max never understood why his name was Reuben but it made a little bit of sense because Reuben was red but it still was pretty weird. Reuben was running late so Max sat on the grass and just looked up to the stars. He saw a set of stars that looked like the bowl he ate his cat food from, and a different set of stars looked like the bucket to refill his food bowl. Then another set of stars looked like the large bag the food came in, and another thing of stars looked like the store you buy the food from. While Max was reminiscing about stars in the shape of food reuben hopped over the fence to meet Max.
